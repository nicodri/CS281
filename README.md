# Yelp Restaurant Classification

Repository of our project with @vigodi during the Harvard course: CS 281 Advanced Machine Learning in Fall 2015.

Goal of the project was to investigate how to use the restaurant reviews to automatically label the restaurants with their categories. The paper describes our method and shows our results.

The repo contains also our code in Python and our exploratory notebooks.
